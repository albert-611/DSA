MEMORY LEAK

A memory leak occurs when a programmers create a memory in a heap and forget to delete it. 
Lead to reduce performance due to depletation of available memory.

-> if initialize a dynamic array 
        int *arr = new int[size];
-> then use this
        delete [] arr;

Then our memory won't leak
