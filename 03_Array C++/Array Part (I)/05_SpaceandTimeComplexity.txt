Space & Time Complexity

NOTE:
In some videos, you will hear words like Space & Time Complexity of Algorithms, Big O, etc.
The concept of Space & Time Complexity is covered in the later part of the course (as an individual chapter).
To understand it beforehand, please read this material.

📘 Scenario

Imagine you give your lucky pen to one of your friends.
Now your exams are approaching, so you would like your pen back.

🧠 Space Complexity

Space Complexity is represented as a function that shows the amount of space necessary for an algorithm to run until completion.

In our scenario, you can think of space complexity as the number of rooms you need to figure out who has the pen.

In computer science, this usually means how much memory the processes and data structures in our code or functions take up to achieve their goal.

⏱️ Time Complexity

Time Complexity is represented as a function that shows the amount of time necessary for an algorithm to run until completion.

In our scenario, time complexity can be represented by the approach you take to find out who has the pen.

In computer science, this typically means how much time the processes and data structures in our code or functions take to achieve their goal.

Time complexity is an umbrella term that includes different types of time complexity.
From fastest to slowest, they are:

Best Case Time Complexity:
The minimum number of operations needed to complete the algorithm.

Amortized Time Complexity:
Similar to average case; it represents the time per operation over a long sequence of operations.

Average Case Time Complexity:
The average number of operations required to complete the algorithm.

Worst Case Time Complexity:
The maximum number of operations needed before completion.

📌 NOTE

Read O(n) as “Big O of n.”

📊 Examples of Complexity Functions

O(n²):
You ask one friend if they have the pen.
You also ask them whether the other 99 friends have the pen.
Then you move on to the next friend and repeat the process.

O(n):
You ask each friend one by one if they have the pen.

O(log n):
You divide the friends into two rooms and ask which room contains the person with the pen.
You keep dividing the correct group into two until only one person remains.

O(1):
You remember who has the pen and go directly to them.

⚠️ Important Point

The Time and Space Complexity of an algorithm is not the actual time or space required to execute the code.

Instead, it represents the number of times a statement executes.

So, complexity is not a measure of real time or memory usage, but a measure of what the code is doing.

🧾 Summary

There can be multiple solutions to the same problem.

We must learn how to compare the performance of different algorithms and choose the best one.

While analyzing an algorithm, we mainly consider:

Time Complexity

Space Complexity

Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to execute instructions.

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory taken by an algorithm as a function of input size.

Although time and space depend on hardware and system factors, we ignore these while analyzing algorithms.

We focus only on the execution behavior of the algorithm.
